# Destination Authoring module in aepp

This documentation will provide you some explanation on how to use the `destination` module and different methods supported by this module.\
It will include some examples but be aware that not all methods will be documented here.\
To have a full view on the different API endpoints specific to the schema API, please refer to this [API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/destination-authoring/).\
Alternatively, you can use the docstring in the methods to have more information.

## Importing the module

Before importing the module, you would need to import the configuration file, or alternatively provide the information required for the API connection through the configure method. [see getting starting](./getting-started.md)

To import the module you can use the import statement with the `destination` keyword.

```python
import aepp
aepp.importConfigFile('myConfig_file.json')

from aepp import destination
```

The destination module provides a class that you can use to generate a SDK taking care of transfering some information to specific destination endpoints.\
The following documentation will provide you with more information on its capabilities.

## The Authoring class

The Authoring class is the default API connector that you would encounter for any other submodules on this python module.\
This class can be instanciated by calling the `Authoring()` from the `destination` module.

Following the previous method described above, you can realize this:

```python
mySDK = destination.Authoring()
```

3 parameters are possible for the instanciation of the class:

* config : OPTIONAL : config object in the config module. (example : aepp.config.config_object)
* header : OPTIONAL : header object  in the config module. (example: aepp.config.header)
* loggingObject : OPTIONAL : logging object to provide log of the application.


## Destination module use-cases

The Destination module will enable you to generate a destination application in AEP.\
This application can then deliver aduience and profile data to the endpoint selected.\
The configuration of that application is stored in the Experience Platform. Note that you can also add some authentication methods to your application.

The destination API supports real-time integration with destinations that have a REST API endpoint.\
The capabilities supported are:
* Message transformation and aggregation
* Profile Backfill
* Configurable metadata integration to initialize audience setup and data transfer
* Configurable authentication
* A suite of testing & validation APIs for you to test and iterate your destination configurations

NOTE: You need to have acces to the Activation package to use this API.

The complete documentation of the destination Authoring API is available in the experience league: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/destination-sdk/overview.html?lang=en
